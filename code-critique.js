// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding Critique with AI

// Enter the following prompt into ChatGPT or similar AI tool.

// Prompt: Create a function that takes in a string and logs the index of the first vowel.

// Copy and paste the code output here.

// Critique the code output. 
// Things to consider in your critique: Were you surprised by the output? Was the output what you expected? Is the correct output being rendered? What do you like about the code? What do you dislike? Are there best practices that are not being followed? Would you take a different approach? What did you learn? 

//This was pretty interrsting. This was my first time working with ChatGPT. Off the bat, since we didnt specify the coding language, the output was actually for a function in python. looking a little closely, I did notice a few things. There is no camel Casing and it looks like to get the output needed, ChatGPT is using conditionals. Also, some form of string interprelation is being used. the output is not quite what I believe is asking to do. ChatGPT instead, gave an answer to how find a vowel in a specific index. Depending on if there is a vowel present, the output will be a new string either stating what the vowel is in that index or a different string stating "no vowels found in '{input_string}'." Although This is my first time analyzing python code, using what Ive learned so far in class, I can still understand what is going on in the putput given by ChatGPT. even though its in a different coding language.
