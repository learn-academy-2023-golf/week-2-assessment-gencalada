# ASSESSMENT 2: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure you are progressing in your professional development.

### Portfolio

This week, we covered the importance of a great technical portfolio to help you stand out in the job market.

- Spend time looking at other developerâ€™s portfolios. Submit the links to three portfolios you will use for inspiration.

1. I love how creative this portfolio is!. Definitely, something I strive to add to mine in the future! I cant even imagine the kind of coding it takes to crate this. https://bruno-simon.com/

2. On this portfolio I enjoyed the interaction yet straitforword design. All the user has to do is scroll leaving the overwhelming feeling from the first example outside. Its not too distracting from the goal which is to showcase yourself. https://www.edwardh.io/

3. As much as I enjoyed the interactiveness and creativity in the previous portfolios' I love the simplicity yet informative and asthetically pleasing view of this portfolio. https://shoaib.xpertzgroup.com/#skills
